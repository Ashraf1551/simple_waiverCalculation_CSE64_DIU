# Tuition Payment and Course Details

My project, titled "Tuition Payment Calculator", is a web application designed to help students calculate tuition fees based on selected semesters and apply waivers to estimate the final payment amount. It includes features such as selecting semesters, displaying actual fees and course lists dynamically, choosing waiver percentages or entering custom percentages, and calculating the discounted payment amount accordingly. The application aims to provide clarity on tuition costs and facilitate financial planning for students at DIU CSE_64 Batch.
